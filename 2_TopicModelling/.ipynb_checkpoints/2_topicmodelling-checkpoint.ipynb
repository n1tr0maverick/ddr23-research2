    "You'll use a Topic Modelling tool from Gensim, a popular library for topic modelling in Python, though these days mainly known for its implementation of Word2Vec to train word embeddings (dense representations). Using this library, you will model topics based on reviews of popular films. The reviews are stored in plain text files, organized by film and rating. The aim of this exercise is to familiarize you with the topic modeling process and its output and to get insight in what kinds of topics are modeled."
